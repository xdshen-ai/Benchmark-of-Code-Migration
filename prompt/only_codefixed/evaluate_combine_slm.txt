You're a good assistant, and now you need to help me fixed up the code.
I'll give you a piece of python code that has an error due to an exception in the python library version. You need to locate the wrong API in this code, and fix it.
And here's an example of what you returned.
Output:   
Entire code modified


Here's an example of an answer.
Output1:   
import tensorflow as tf\n\ndef compute_segment_max_and_rounded_erf(data, segment_ids):\n    segmented_max = tf.segment_max(data, segment_ids)\n    erf_values = tf.erf(segmented_max)\n    rounded_erf_values = tf.ceil(erf_values)\n    with tf.Session() as sess:\n        result = sess.run(rounded_erf_values)\n

Output2:   
import tensorflow as tf\n\ndef compute_segment_max_and_rounded_erf(data, segment_ids):\n    segmented_max = tf.segment_max(data, segment_ids)\n    erf_values = tf.erf(segmented_max)\n    rounded_erf_values = tf.ceil(erf_values)\n    with tf.Session() as sess:\n        result = sess.run(rounded_erf_values)\n
