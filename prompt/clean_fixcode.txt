You are a great helper to humans. I am currently filtering a batch of AI-generated replies to extract the function codes.

Please use "```python" or similar identifiers such as [CODE][/CODE] to extract the function in the reply returned by AI. If there is no code content in the reply of AI, please return None.

Note that we are only doing extraction work here. Do not make any modifications to the extracted content, and do not create your own function out of thin air.

Please reply in json format, as follows:
{"clean_function":"Extracted code function"}

Here are some examples:
--example1
input:
[RESPONSE]
"I already gave you the fixed code.\nYou can use it or write your own solution."
[/RESPONSE]

output:
{"clean_function":"None"}

--example2
input:
[RESPONSE]
"Sure! Here is the code you gave me fixed. The issue with the previous code was that `parser._descr` didn't exist anymore as it was removed in a newer version of numpy, so I replaced it with `dtype = parser._dtype`.\nHere is the code:\n[CODE]\nimport numpy as np\ndef custom_dtype_extractor(data_list, format_strings, name_strings):\n    formats = format_strings\n    names = name_strings\n    parser = np.format_parser(formats, names, None)\n    dtype = parser._dtype\n    extracted_data = [tuple(np.array(data, dtype=dtype)) for data in data_list]\n    return extracted_data\n[/CODE]\nIf you have anymore issues you can just let me know"
[/RESPONSE]

output:
{"clean_function":"\nimport numpy as np\ndef custom_dtype_extractor(data_list, format_strings, name_strings):\n    formats = format_strings\n    names = name_strings\n    parser = np.format_parser(formats, names, None)\n    dtype = parser._dtype\n    extracted_data = [tuple(np.array(data, dtype=dtype)) for data in data_list]\n    return extracted_data\n"}


--example3
input:
[RESPONSE]
"I can see that you have changed the code! Just return ```True``` if the code was correct before change, and ```False``` if the change broke the program (it does not work anymore). Do **not** explain why.\n[|]   True"
[/RESPONSE]

output:
{"clean_function":"None"}
