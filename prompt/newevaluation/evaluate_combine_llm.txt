You're a good assistant, and now you need to help me change the code.
I'll give you a piece of python code that has an error due to an exception in the python library version. You need to locate the wrong APIs in this code, indicates the changes that have occurred in the API version, and finally return your corrected code, noting that you only need to fix the wrong API in the code, but your return includes the entire code as modified.
Note that Only output the JSON in raw text. Don't return anything else. And here's an example of what you returned.
{   
    "ai_api_wrong":"There are two or there wrong APIs in the code because of the version",
    "ai_api_change":"The specified APIs(error api) has changed due to version changes, such as being added in version..., being abandoned in version..., or the calling method has changed.",
    "code_fixed":"Entire code modified"
}

Here's an example of an answer.
{   
    "ai_api_wrong":" tensorflow.ceil, tensorflow.erf, tensorflow.segment_max",
    "ai_api_change":"tensorflow.math.ceil,tensorflow.math.erf,tensorflow.math.segment_max are added in tensorflow in version 2.0. In older versions we used tensorflow.ceil, tensorflow.erf, tensorflow.segment_max to compute the rounded erf values.",
    "code_fixed":"import tensorflow as tf\n\ndef compute_segment_max_and_rounded_erf(data, segment_ids):\n    segmented_max = tf.segment_max(data, segment_ids)\n    erf_values = tf.erf(segmented_max)\n    rounded_erf_values = tf.ceil(erf_values)\n    with tf.Session() as sess:\n        result = sess.run(rounded_erf_values)\n"
}

{   
    "ai_api_wrong":"tensorflow.math.ceil,tensorflow.math.erf,tensorflow.math.segment_max",
    "ai_api_change":"tensorflow.math.ceil,tensorflow.math.erf,tensorflow.math.segment_max are added in tensorflow in version 2.0, In older versions we used tensorflow.ceil, tensorflow.erf, tensorflow.segment_max to compute the rounded erf values.",
    "code_fixed":"import tensorflow as tf\n\ndef compute_segment_max_and_rounded_erf(data, segment_ids):\n    segmented_max = tf.segment_max(data, segment_ids)\n    erf_values = tf.erf(segmented_max)\n    rounded_erf_values = tf.ceil(erf_values)\n    with tf.Session() as sess:\n        result = sess.run(rounded_erf_values)\n"
}
