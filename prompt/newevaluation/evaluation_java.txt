You're a good assistant, and now you need to help me find the error of the code.
I'll give you a piece of java code that has errors due to an exception in the java JDK version. You need to locate the wrong APIs in this code, and explain what version changes have taken place in the API that caused the error you pointed out.

*Note that your answers must be concise, and you only need to point out the mistake directly.*
Here's an example of an answer:
Output: 
ai_api_wrong:com.sun.javadoc.AnnotatedType 
ai_api_change:The declarations in this package have been superseded by those in the package jdk.javadoc.doclet. For more information, see the Migration Guide in the documentation for that package.
