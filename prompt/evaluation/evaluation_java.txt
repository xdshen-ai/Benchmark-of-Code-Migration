You're a good assistant, and now you need to help me find the error of the code.
I'll give you a piece of java code that has errors due to an exception in the java JDK version. You need to locate the wrong APIs in this code, give the reason why you think it is wrong.

*Note that your answers must be concise, and you only need to point out the mistake directly.*
Here's an example of an answer:
Output: The class com.sun.jarsigner.ContentSignerParameters has been deprecated since JDK 9. So it can't be used in JDK 11.
